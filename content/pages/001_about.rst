Eliens is UPLB's competitive programming team. The team name "Eliens" 
was selected to honor Dr. Eliezer A. Albacea, one of the first Computer Scientists 
in the Philippines. UPLB has been participating in intercollegiate programming competitions since 2000.
Our vision is to be able to represent the Philippines in the `ICPC World Finals <https://icpc.global/>`_.
Dr. Rafael Saldanai(ADMU) and Dr. Allan Sioson(ADNU) are instrumental in bringing competitive programming, specifically ACM-ICPC, to the Philippines. Prof. Concepcion L. Khan funded the first few teams from UPLB which participated in the early ACM-ICPC regionals hosted in PH.
